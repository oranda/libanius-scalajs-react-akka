== 0.6 Oct 27 2019

 * Updated to use the latest libanius-akka library, i.e. version 0.4.

 * Added Akka TestKit tests.


== 0.5.1 Oct 20 2019

 * Updated to use the latest libanius-akka library, i.e. version 0.3.1.

 * Increased usage of QuizGroupKey more. New class: QuizGroupKeyReact, a client-side version.


== 0.5 Oct 19 2019

 * Manually forked libanius-scaljs-react. (It could have been a branch but a fork is a bit
  more accessible and a bit less error-prone.) It progresses from the version number of the
  original, but the functionality and version numbers may diverge.

 * This fork uses Akka Cluster. Also, instead of the libanius library, it is built on the
  libanius-akka library, which uses Akka Persistence.

 * The main new classes are QuizUsersService, QuizUsersGateway, and QuizForUserSharding. The
  last maintains the cluster of QuizForUserActor's.

 * The feature whereby a user could save quiz data to local disk has been removed, at least
  temporarily. Data is kept on the server in an event-sourcing journal.
